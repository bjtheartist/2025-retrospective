METHODOLOGY NOTES
---
"This dataset includes equity, debt, and strategic capital deployed to Chicago-headquartered startups in 2025."
"Each deal was verified against primary sources where available: SEC filings, press releases, and credible reporting."
"Deals are marked 'Verified' when confirmed via primary source, 'Flagged' when details need confirmation, 'Unverified' when sourced from aggregators only."
"Where deal amounts were undisclosed, we note the gap but include the deal in our count."
"Chicago connection: Company must be HQ'd in Chicago metro area OR have significant Chicago operations."
"PE recaps and debt facilities are included as 'growth capital' - this differs from pure VC methodology."
---
"Data compiled: January 2026"
"Total Verified Deals: 64"
"Total Disclosed Capital: $2.99B"
"Corrections applied: 15+ deals removed after failing verification"
